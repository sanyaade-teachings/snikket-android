This new release brings an updated visual design, many reliability,
performance and security enhancements.

The new design brings a new default color palette, but can optionally follow
the system theme colours (aka "Material You" or "Dynamic Colors") for a more
personalized experience. A new larger font setting is available for people who
prefer a boost to the system's default font size for their messages. Many
other customizations can be made in the settings.

Speaking of which, the settings page has been simplified and restructured, to
make it easier to find options that you are looking for.

Some other highlights include:

Reading messages will now synchronize the read status to your other devices
automatically. Previously reading a message on one device would leave it
"unread" on your other device(s).

Audio/video calls are now more closely integrated into the Android, which
brings various benefits including improved call notification handling.

Custom per-contact notification settings are now easily accessible from the
chat menu.

The app's backup mechanism has been improved (you can find it in the
settings). You can now schedule automatic backups to a chosen location on your
device. Using other apps, these backups can be uploaded to a secure location
off your device.

Recording of audio messages can be paused by tapping the timer.

Enjoy!
